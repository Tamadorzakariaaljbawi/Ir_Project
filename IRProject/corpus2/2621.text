A High Security Log-in ProcedureThe protection of time sharing systems from unauthorized users is often achieved by the use of passwords.  By using one-way ciphers to code the passwords, the risks involved with storing the passwords in the computer can be avoided.  We discuss the selection of a suitable one-way cipher and suggest that for this purpose polynomials over a prime modulus are superior to one-way ciphers derived from Sannon codes.CACM August, 1974Purdy, G.
