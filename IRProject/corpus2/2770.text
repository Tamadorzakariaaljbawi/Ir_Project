The Quadratic Hash Method When the Table Size Is Not a Prime NumberPrevious work on quadratic hash methods is limited mainly to the case where the table size is a prime number.  Here, certain results are derived for composite numbers.  It is shown that all composite numbers containing at least the square of one of the component primes have full-period integer-coefficient quadratic hash functions.CACM April, 1975Batagelj, V.quadratic search, hash code, scatter storage, table size3.74 4.10CA750407 JB January 9, 1978  3:54 PM
