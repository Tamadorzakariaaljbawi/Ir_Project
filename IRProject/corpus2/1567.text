On the Representation of Symmetric PolynomialsRelations are given between certain symmetric polynomials in the light of the theory of the symmetric group.  Such an approach unifies earlier work and lends insight to previously published work by Aaron Booker.  A generalization of Graeffe's root-squaring technique for the determination of the roots of a polynomial is suggested.CACM July, 1967McKay, J. K. S.CA670706 JB February 28, 1978  8:56 AM
