Optimal Storage Allocation for Serial FilesA computer system uses several serial files.  The files reside on a direct-access storage device in which storage space is limited.  Records are added to the files either by jobs in batch processing mode, or by on-line transactions. Each transaction (or job) generates a demand vector which designates the space required in each file for record addition. Whenever one file runs out of space, the system must be reorganized.  This paper considers several criteria for best allocating storage space to the files.CACM February, 1979Mendelson, H. Pliskin, J.S.
