An Environment for Research in Microprogramming and EmulationThe development of the research project in microprogramming and emulation at State University of New York at Buffalo consisted of three phases: the evaluation of various possible machines to support this research; the decision to purchase one such machine, which appears to be superior to the others considered; and the organization and definition of goals for each group in the project.  Each of these phases is reported, with emphasis placed on the early results achieved in this research.CACM August, 1972Rosin, R. F. Frieder, G. Eckhouse Jr., R.
