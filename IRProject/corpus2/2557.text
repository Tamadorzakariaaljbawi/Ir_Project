On the Time Required for a Sequence of Matrix ProductsThis paper discusses the multiplication of conformable sequences of row vectors, column vectors, and square matrices.  The minimum time required to evaluate such products on ordinary serial computers as well as parallel computers is discussed.  Algorithms are presented which properly parse such matrix sequences subject to the constraints of the machine organization.CACM January, 1973Muraoka, Y. Kuck, D.
