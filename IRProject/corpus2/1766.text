Quasilinearization and the Estimation of Differential Operators from EigenvaluesGiven a linear ordinary differential operator containing several unknown constants and a number of its eigenvalues, the values of the unknown constants are estimated.  A precise formulation is provided, and an effective numerical procedure for solution is indicated. The results of some computational experiments are given.CACM April, 1968Bellman, R. E. Kagiwada, H.
