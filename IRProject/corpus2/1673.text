Approximate Solution of Initial Boundary Wave Equation Problems by Boundary-Value TechniquesA new boundary-value technique is proposed for the treatment of initial-boundary-value problems for linear and mildly nonlinear wave equations.   Several illustrative examples are offered to demonstrate the ease with which the method can be applied.CACM November, 1968Greenspan, D.initial-boundary-value problem, wave equation, boundary-value technique5.15 5.17CA681106 JB February 21, 1978  2:48 PM
