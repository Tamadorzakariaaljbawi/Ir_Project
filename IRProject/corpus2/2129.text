Recursive Computation of Certain Derivatives-A Study of Error PropagationA brief study is made of the propagation of errors in linear first-order difference equations.  The recursive computation of successive derivatives of (e^x)/x and (cos x)/x is considered as an illustration.CACM January, 1970Gautschi, W.recursive computation, successive derivatives, error propagation5.11 5.12CA700102 JB February 14, 1978  2:18 PM
