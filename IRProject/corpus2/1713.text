On Overcoming High-Priority Paralysis in Multiprogramming Systems: A Case His toryHigh-priority paralysis is the degradation that can occur in multiprogramming systems when scheduling is based primarily on preassigned priorities. It can be alleviated by modifying the scheduling algorithm to maximize the number of programs active at one time.  The case his tory given in this paper indicates two general methods by which simultaneity can be increased.  Possible refinements in the scheduling algorithm for future improvements are considered briefly.CACM August, 1968Stevens, D.
