Sorting by Natural SelectionA family of sorting algorithms is proposed, the members of which make fuller use of the memory space and thus yield longer sorted strings.  Extensive simulation results are presented, and various implications and further applications are discussed.CACM October, 1972Frazer, W. D. Wong, C.
