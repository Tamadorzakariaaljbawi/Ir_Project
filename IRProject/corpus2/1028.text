Investigation of a New Analytical Method for Numerical Derivative EvaluationA recently proposed analytical approach to numerical derivative evaluation is discussed.  The technique is shown to be both accurate and easy to apply, though certain indicated modifications are required.  Its use should greatly facilitate the writing and debugging of programs requiring derivatives of highly complex functions.CACM August, 1964Wilkins, R. D.CA640802 JB March 9, 1978  7:31 PM
