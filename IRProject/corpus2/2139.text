Implementation of the Substring Test by HashingA technique is described for implementing the test which determines if one string is a substring of another.  When there is low probability that the test will be satisfied, it is shown how the operation can be speeded up considerably if it is preceded by a test on appropriately chosen hash codes of the strings.CACM December, 1971Harrison, M.
