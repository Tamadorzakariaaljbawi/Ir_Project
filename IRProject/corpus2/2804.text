Elementary Divisors of Tensor ProductsThe elementary divisors of a tensor product of linear transformations have been known for 40 years.  This paper provides a short, easily accessible proof of these results, and points out an interesting combinatorial consequence of the proof.CACM January, 1975Marcus, M.
