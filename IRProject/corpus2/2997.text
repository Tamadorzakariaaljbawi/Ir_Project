Convex Hulls of Finite Sets of Poin ts in Two and Three DimensionsThe convex hulls of sets of n poin ts in two and three dimensions can be determined with O(n log n) operations.  The presented algorithms use the "divide and conquer" technique and recursively apply a merge procedure for two nonin tersecting convex hulls. Since any convex hull algorithm requires at least O(n log n) operations, the time complexity of the proposed algorithms is optimal within a multiplicative constant.CACM February, 1977Preparata, F. P.
