Optimal Starting Approximations for Generating Square Root for Slow or No DivideOn machine with slow or no division, it is preferable to use an iterative scheme for the square root different from the classical Heron scheme.  The problem of optimal initial approximants is considered, and some optimal polynomial initial approximations are tabulated.CACM September, 1970Wilson, M.
