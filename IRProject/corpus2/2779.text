Discrete Least Squares Polynomial FitsThe recurrence relation between orthogonal polynomials is widely used for discrete least squares data fitting.  A variant of the classical algorithm which has better numerical properties is presented and the reason for its improved performance is explained.CACM March, 1975Shampine, L.
