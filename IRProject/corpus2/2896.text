An Exercise in Proving Parallel Programs CorrectA parallel program, Dijkstra's on-the-fly garbage collector, is proved correct using a proof method developed by Owicki.  The fine degree of in terleaving in this program makes it especially difficult to understand, and complicates the proof greatly.  Difficulties with proving such parallel programs correct are discussed.CACM December, 1977Gries, D.garbage collection, multiprocessing, program correctness for multiprocessing tasks4.32 4.34 4.35 4.39 5.24CA771204 JB February 1, 1980  3:37 AM
