A Contour-Map Program for X-Ray CrystallographyA FORTRAN program is described for use with the IBM 7090 system and an X, Y-plotter to produce a contour map.  A matrix of points evenly spaced in each dimension is contoured.  Scale factors along the axes may be different and the axes need not be perpendicular.CACM October, 1963Dayhoff, M.
