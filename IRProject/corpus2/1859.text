Error Bounds for Periodic Quintic SplinesExplicit error bounds for periodic quintic spline interpolation are developed.  The first (third) derivative of the periodic spline is shown to be a sixth (fourth) order approximation at the mesh points to the first (third) derivative of the function being interpolated.CACM August, 1969Hall, C.
