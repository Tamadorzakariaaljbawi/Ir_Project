Insertions and Deletions In One-Sided Height-Balanced TreesRecently Hirschberg has established that insertions into one-sided height-balanced trees can be done in 0(log^2N) steps.  It is proved here that deletions can also be performed in 0(log^2N) steps, which answers the open problem posed by Hirschberg.CACM March, 1978Kosaraju, S.R.AVL trees, balanced trees, binary search, dynamic balancing3.73 3.74 4.34 5.25 5.31CA780304 JB March 28, 1978  1:12 PM
