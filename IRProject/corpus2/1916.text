Analysis of Boolean Program Models for Time-Shared, Paged EnvironmentsDirected graphs or their associated matrices are frequently used to represent the logical structure of sequences of computer instructions.  Such techniques are used and, in addition, data references are represented in a nondirected model. The complete structural specification of a program is represented by a combined model.  A transformation of the combined model yields a new model in which additional timing information is also contained.  Analysis of these models prior to execution yields information valuable in determining segmentation of instructions and data for a time-shared environment, as well as for initial page loading; during execution, the analysis may be used for "look ahead" control of page turning.CACM April, 1969Lowe, T.
