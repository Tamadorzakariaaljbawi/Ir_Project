A Formal System for Information Retrieval from FilesA generalized file structure is provided by which the concepts of keyword, index, record, file, directory, file structure, directory decoding, and record retrieval are defined and from which some of the frequently used file structures such as inverted files, index-sequential files, and multilist files are derived.  Two algorithms which retrieve records from the generalized file structure are presented.CACM February, 1970Hsiao, D.attribute-value pair, index, keyword, record, record address, K-pointer, K-list, file, directory, generalized file structure, inverted file, index-sequential-file, multilist file, description, file search, directory search, serial processing of lists, prime keyword, parallel processing of lists3.70 3.73 3.74CA700201 JB February 14, 1978  1:04 PM
