Half Rotations in N-Dimensional Euclidean SpaceAn iterative procedure is described for determining half rotations in n-dimensional Euclidean space. The method is a variant of the cyclic Jacobi procedure and utilizers elementary plane rotations to obtain the half rotation matrix.  Numerical examples are given.CACM September, 1966McCamon, R.
