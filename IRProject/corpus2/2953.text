Notes on Recursion EliminationVarious methods of recursion elimination are applied to the schematic recursive procedure: proc S(x); px then N(x); S(fx); S(gx); M(x) fi.  Procedures with this general form arise in connection with tree traversal and sorting algorithms.  Each method of recursion removal involves the use of one or more stacks, and the solutions are compared on the basis of their running time.CACM June, 1977Bird, R.
