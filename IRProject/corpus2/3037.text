A Linear Sieve Algorithm for Finding Prime NumbersA new algorithm is presented for finding all primes between 2 and n.  The algorithm executes in time proportional to n (assuming that multiplication of integers not larger than n can be performed in unit time).  The method has the same arithmetic complexity as the algorithm presented by Mairson [6]; however, our version is perhaps simpler and more elegant. It is also easily extended to find the prime factorization of all integers between 2 and n in time proportional to n.CACM December, 1978Gries, D.
