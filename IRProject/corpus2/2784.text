Expected Time Bounds for SelectionA new selection algorithm is presented which is shown to be very efficient on the average, both theoretically and practically.  The number of comparisons used to select the ith smallest of n numbers is n+min(i,n-i)+o(n).  A lower bound within 9 percent of the above formula is also derived.CACM March, 1975Floyd, R. W.
