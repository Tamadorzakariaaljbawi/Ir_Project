A Precise Numerical Analysis ProgramA description is given of a program for computing the solution to a small number of standard numerical analysis problems to any specified accuracy, up to a limit of 2000 correct decimal places. Each computed number is bounded in an interval with a multiple precision midpoint.  Arithmetic operations involving these numbers are executed according to interval arithmetic concepts, with non-significant digits automatically discarded.  Details are supplied of problem specification and problem computation.CACM September, 1974Aberth, O.interval arithmetic, multiple precision, list structure, error control4.49 5.10 5.11 5.12 5.14 5.19CA740903 JB January 17, 1978  9:01 AM
