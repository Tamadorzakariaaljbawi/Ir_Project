Further Evidence for the Analysis of Algorithms for the Zero-One Programming ProblemThe purpose of this note is to report computational experience additional to that recently summarized by Gue et al, with two algorithms for the zero-one linear programming problem.  An error in Gue's paper is corrected.  The utility of one of the algorithms as a suboptimizer is indicated.CACM January, 1971Proll, L.
