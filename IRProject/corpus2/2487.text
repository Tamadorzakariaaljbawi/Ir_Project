Cubic Spline solutions to Fourth-order Boundary Value ProblemsThe cubic spline approximation to the fourth-order differential equation y''''+p(x)y''+q(x)y'+r(x)y=t(x) is shown to reduce to the solution of a five-term recurrence relationship.  For some special cases the approximation is shown to be simply related to a finite difference representation with a local truncation error of order (y/720)delta^8.CACM June, 1973Hoskins, W.
