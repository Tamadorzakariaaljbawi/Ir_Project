An Approximate Method for Generating Asymmetric Random VariablesTukey's lambda distribution is generalized to provide an algorithm for generating values of unimodal asymmetric random variables.  This algorithm has the same advantages as the symmetric random variable generator previously given by the authors, except that the addition of another parameter complicates the problem of finding the parameter values to fit a distribution.CACM February, 1974Ramberg, J.
