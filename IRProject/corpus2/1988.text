A Formalism for Translator InteractionsA formalism is presented for describing the actions of processors for programming languages-compilers, interpreters, assemblers-and their interactions in complex systems such as compiler-compilers or extendible languages. The formalism here might be used to define and answer such a question as "Can one do bootstrapping using a meta-compiler whose metaphase is interpretive?"  In addition an algorithm is presented for deciding whether or not a given system can be produced from a given set of component processors.CACM October, 1970Earley, J.translator, compiler, interpreter, bootstrapping, language processor, compiler-compiler4.1 5.29CA701002 JB February 10, 1978  9:36 AM
