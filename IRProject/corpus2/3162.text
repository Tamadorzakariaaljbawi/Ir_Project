On Improving the Worst Case Running Time of the Boyer-Moore String Matching AlgorithmIt is shown how to modify the Boyer-Moore string matching algorithm so that its worst case running time is linear even when multiple occurrences of the pattern are present in the text.CACM September, 1979Galil, Z.Computational complexity, linear time, worst case, string matching, periodicity3.74 4.40 5.25CA790903 DB January 14, 1980  10:27 AM
