On the Numerical Solution of an N-Point Boundary Value Problem for Linear Ordinary Differential EquationsA method for the numerical solution of then-point boundary value problem for homogeneous linear ordinary differential equations is developed.  The method requires two Runge-Kutta integrations over the interval under consideration and the solution of a linear system of equations with n-1 unknowns.CACM April, 1965Day, J.
