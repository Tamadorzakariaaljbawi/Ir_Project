Automatic Error Analysis for Determining PrecisionThe problem considered is that of evaluating a rational expression to within any desired tolerance on a computer which performs variable-precision floating-point arithmetic operations.    An automatic error analysis technique is given for determining, directly from the results of a trial low-precision interval arithmetic calculation, just how much precision and data accuracy are required to achieve a desired final accuracy.  The technique given generalize easily to the evaluation of many nonrational expressions.CACM September, 1972Richman, P.
