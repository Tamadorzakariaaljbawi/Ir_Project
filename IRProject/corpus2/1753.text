Virtual Memory, Processes, and Sharing in MULTICSSome basic concepts involved in the design of the MULTICS operating system are introduced. MULTICS concepts of processes, address space, and virtual memory are defined and the use of paging and segmentation is explained.  The means by which users may share procedures and data is discussed and the mechanism by which symbolic references are dynamically transformed into virtual machine addresses is described in detail.CACM May, 1968Daley, R.
