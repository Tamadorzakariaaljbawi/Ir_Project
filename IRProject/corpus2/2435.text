A Class of Dynamic Memory Allocation AlgorithmsAnew dynamic memory allocation algorithm, the Fibonacci system, is introduced.  This algorithm is similar to, but seems to have certain advantages over, the "buddy" system.  A generalization is mentioned which includes both of these systems as special cases.CACM October, 1973Hirschberg, D.
