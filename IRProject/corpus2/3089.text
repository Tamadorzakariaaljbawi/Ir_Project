Performance of Rollback Recovery Systems under Intermittent FailuresA mathematical model of a transaction-oriented system under intermittent failures is proposed. The system is assumed to operate with a checkpointing and rollback/recovery method to ensure reliable information processing.  The model is used to derive the principal performance measures, including availability, response time, and the system saturation point.CACM June, 1978Gelenbe, E.
