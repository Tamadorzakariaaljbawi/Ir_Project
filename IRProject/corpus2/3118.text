Permutation of Data Blocks in a Bubble MemoryA common internal organization of bubble memories consists of a set of (minor) loops, connected through another (major) loop.  The problem of obtaining any give n permutation of the minor loop contents in minimum time is studied in this paper.  A lower bound to the number of steps required buy a permutation algorithm is derived, and the class of optimum algorithms is identified.CACM January, 1979Bongiovanni, G.C.
