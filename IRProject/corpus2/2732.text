Guarded Commands, Nondeterminacy and Formal Derivation of ProgramsSo-called "guarded commands" are introduced as a building block for alternative and repetitive constructs that allow nondeterministic program components for which at least the activity evoked, but possible even the final state, is not necessarily uniquely determined by the initial state.  For the formal derivation of programs expressed in terms of these constructs, a calculus will be shown.CACM August, 1975Dijkstra, E.
