Generation of Positive Test Matrices with Known Positive SpectraSufficient conditions are given for a real matrix to be similar to a positive matrix.  This result is used to construct a similarity transformation which, when applied to a particular upper triangular matrix, yields a positive matrix with a preassigned positive spectrum.CACM August, 1968Hall, C.
