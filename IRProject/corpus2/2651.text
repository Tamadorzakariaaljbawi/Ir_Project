The Treatment of Data Types in EL1In constructing a general purpose programming language, a key issue is providing a sufficient set of data types and associated operations in a manner that permits both natural problem-oriented notation and efficient implementation.  The EL1 language contains a number of features specifically designed to simultaneously satisfy both requirements.  The resulting treatment of data types includes provision for programmer-defined data types data types and generic routines, programmer control over type conversion, and very flexible data type behavior, in a context that allows efficient compiled code and compact data representation.CACM May, 1974Wegbreit, B.data types, modes, mode unions, type conversion, coercion, generic functions, extensible languages, data type definition, data description language, compilation4.12 4.13 4.22CA740502 JB January 17, 1978  4:32 PM
