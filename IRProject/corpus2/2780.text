On Computing Certain Elements of the Inverse of a Sparse MatrixA recursive algorithm for computing the inverse of a matrix from the LU factors based on relationships in Takahashi, et al., is examined.  The formulas for the algorithm are given; the dependency relationships are derived; the computational costs are developed; and some general comments on application and stability are made.CACM March, 1975Erisman, E.
