Two Hadamard Numbers for MatricesA discussion is given of two functions of the entries of a square matrix, both related to Hadamard's determinant theorem, which have some merits as alternatives to norm-bound "condition numbers."  One (for linear systems) is known; the other (for eigen systems) seems to be new.CACM January, 1975Birkhoff, G.matrices, eigenvalues, norms, condition numbers, error analysis, Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization5.11 5.14CA750105 JB January 12, 1978  10:37 AM
