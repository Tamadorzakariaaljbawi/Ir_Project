Fast Finite-Difference Solution of Biharmonic ProblemsSetting the Reynolds number equal to zero, in a method for solving the Navier-Strokes equations numerically, results in a fast numerical method for biharmonic problems.  The equation is treated as a system of two second order equations and a simple smoothing process is essential for convergence. An application is made to a crack-type problem.CACM May, 1972Greenspan, D.
