Cubic Splines on Uniform MeshesA very simple procedure is presented for constructing cubic splines, periodic or nonperiodic, on uniform meshes.  Arcs of two cubics suffice to construct a basis of cardinal splines.  An algorithm is given which requires only minimal storage and computation and permits easy trade-off of one against the other.CACM April, 1970Nilson, E.
