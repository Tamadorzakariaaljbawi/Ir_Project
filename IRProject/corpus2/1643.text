An Improvement to Iterative Methods of Polynomial FactorizationMethods of polynomial factorization which find the zeros one at a time require the division of the polynomial by the accepted factor.  It is shown how the accuracy of this division may be increased by dividing in order of both ascending and descending powers of the variable and choosing a crossover point which minimizes a very simply calculated error criterion.CACM January, 1967Bingham, J.
