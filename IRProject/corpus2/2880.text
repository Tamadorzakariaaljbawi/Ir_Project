A Fast Division Technique for Constant DivisorsA fast algorithm for division by constant divisors is presented.  The method has proved very useful implemented as microcode ona binary machine, and can be adapted directly into hardware.  The mathematical foundations of the algorithm are presented as well as some performance measures.CACM February, 1976Artzy, E. Hinds, J. A. Saal, H.
