On Arithmetic Expressions and TreesA description is given of how a tree representing the evaluation of an arithmetic expression can be drawn in such a way that the number of accumulators needed for the computation can be represented in a straightforward manner.  This representation reduces the choice of the best order of computation to a specific problem under the theory of graphs. An algorithm to solve this problem is presented.CACM February, 1969Redziejowski, R.
