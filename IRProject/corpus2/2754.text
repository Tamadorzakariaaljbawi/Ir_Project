A Syntactic Algorithm for Peak Detection in Waveforms with Applications to CardiographyPeaks in a digitized waveform are detected by an algorithm incorporating piecewise linear approximation and tabular parsing techniques.  Several parameters serve to identify the waveform context enabling accurate measurement of peak amplitude, duration, and shape.  The algorithm is of sufficient speed to allow on-line real-time processing.  An example of its application is demonstrated on an electrocardiogram.CACM May, 1975Horowitz, S.
