The Parallel Execution of DO LoopsMethods are developed for the parallel execution of different iterations of a DO loop.  Both asynchronous multiprocessor computers and array computers are considered.  Practical application to the design of compilers for such computers is discussed.CACM February, 1974Lamport, L.parallel computing, multiprocessor computers, array computers, vector computers, loops4.12 5.24CA740204 JB January 18, 1978  1:14 PM
