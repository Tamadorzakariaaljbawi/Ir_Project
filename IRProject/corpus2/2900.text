Some Theorems to Aid in Solving the File Allocation ProblemThe file allocation problem-i.e. the problem of finding the optimal set of network sites at which to locate copies of a file-is known to be, in general, polynomial complete.  Heuristics and other aids to finding optimal, or near-optimal, solutions are therefore much needed.  In this paper we present three theorems which can be applied a priori to indicate that certain sites should (or should not) be included in an optimal allocation.CACM November, 1977Grapa, E.
