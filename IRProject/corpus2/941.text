A Recursive Program for the General n-Dimensional IntegralA general program is outlined for n-dimensional integration with variable limits.  The program is of a recursive nature and uses Simpson's rule combined with repeated bisection to attain the required accuracy.  It was developed in the Ferranti Mercury Autocode Scheme.CACM January, 1963Cadwell, J. H.CA630107 JB March 14, 1978  2:43 PM
