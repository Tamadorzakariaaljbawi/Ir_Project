Incorporation of Units into Programming LanguagesThe issues of how a programming language might aid in keeping track of physical units (feet, sec, etc.) are discussed.  A method is given for the introduction of relationships among units (a watt is volts*amps, a yard is three feet) and subsequent automatic conversion based upon these relationships. Various proposals for syntax are considered.CACM May, 1978Karr, M. Loveman III, D.B.Units, language design, compiler construction, language syntax4.12 4.22CA780505 DH February 26, 1979  1:43 PM
