Object code OptimizationMethods of analyzing the control flow and data flow of programs during compilation are applied to transforming the program to improve object time efficiency. Dominance relationships, indicating which statements are necessarily executed before others, are used to do global common expression elimination and loop identification.  Implementation of these and other optimizations in OS/360 FORTRAN H are described.CACM January, 1969Lowry, E. S. Medlock, C.
