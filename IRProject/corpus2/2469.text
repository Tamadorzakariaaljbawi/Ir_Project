Petri Nets and Speed Independent designPetri nets are investigated as one method of modeling speed independent asynchronous circuits. A study of circuit realizations of Petri nets leads to a demonstration of their usefulness in modeling speed independent operation.  This usefulness is emphasized by the design of a speed independent processor from modules developed in the investigation of Petri net implementation.CACM August, 1973Misunas, D.speed independent asynchronous, Petri net6.1 6.33CA730805 JB January 23, 1978  10:46 AM
