Matrix Computations with Fortran and PagingThe efficiency of conventional Fortran programs for matrix computations can often be improved by reversing the order of nested loops.  Such modifications produce modest savings in many common situations and very significant savings for large problems run under an operating system which uses paging.CACM April, 1972Moler, C.
