Several underlying conceptual structures are identified: (1) a transaction is an event that occurs in the computer and involves some operation on some object at some location, (2) a prestatement is a set of transactions corresponding to a line of code, (3) chunks are frequently occurring configurations of prestatements corresponding to several lines of code.CACM November, 1979Mayer, R.E.BASIC, Learning, instruction1.50 3.36 4.22CA791101 DB January 17, 1980  10:38 AM
