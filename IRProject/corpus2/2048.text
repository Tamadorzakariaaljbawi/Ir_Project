Comparison of Several Adaptive Newton-Cotes Quadrature Routines in Evaluating Definite Integrals with Peaked IntegrandsThis report compares the performance of five different adaptive quadrature schemes, based on Newton-Cotes (2N + 1) point rules (N = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), in approximating the set of definite integrals INTEGRAL$1/(x^2 + p^2)) dx with relative accuracy e.CACM June, 1970Hillstrom, K.
