The MAD Definition FacilityOne of the first definition facilities for higher level languages is described.  Users of the language can define new operators and/or data types into the MAD language, so that their use appears as if they were predefined.  Information is given on how one writes definitions, as well as on much of the motivation behind the form in which definitions are written. Some conclusions are drawn about future definitional facilities.CACM August, 1969Arden, B. W. Galler, B. A. Graham, R.
