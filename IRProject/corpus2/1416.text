A Fortran Technique for Simplifying Input to Report GeneratorsTypical report generators allow the production of standard forms when tabulating a magnetic tape file; the extraction of nonstandard sets of information, with suitable annotation, involves troublesome forms design.  A method of information extraction involving the calculation of suitable FORTRAN FORMAT statements, which combats this problem, is described.CACM June, 1966Cleary, J.
