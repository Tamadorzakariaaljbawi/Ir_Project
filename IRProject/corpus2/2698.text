Syntax-Directed Least-Errors Analysis for Context-Free Languages: A Practical ApproachA least-errors recognizer is developed informally using the well-known recognizer of Earley, along with elements of Bellman's dynamic programming. The analyzer takes a general class of context-free grammars as drivers, and any finite string as input. Recognition consists of a least-errors count for a corrected version of the input relative to the driver grammar. The algorithm design emphasizes practical aspects which help in programming it.CACM January, 1974Lyon, G.arbitrary input strings, context-free grammars, parsing, dynamic programming, stored subanalyses, separability, state merging, least-errors correction4.12 5.23 5.42CA740101 JB January 18, 1978   2:57 PM
