Using Encryption for Authentication in Large Networks of ComputersUse of encryption to achieve authenticated communication in computer networks is discussed. Example protocols are presented for the establishment of authenticated connections, for the management of authenticated mail, and for signature verification and document integrity guarantee.  Both conventional and public-key encryption algorithms are considered as the basis for protocols.CACM December, 1978Needham, R.M.
