Protection and the Control of Information Sharing in MulticsThe design of mechanisms to control the sharing of information in the Multics system is described. Five design principles help provide insight into the tradeoffs among different possible designs.  The key mechanisms described include access control lists, hierarchical control of access specifications, identification and authentication of users, and primary memory protection.  The paper ends with a discussion of several known weaknesses in the current protection mechanism design.CACM July, 1974Saltzer, J.
