A Nonrecursive List Moving AlgorithmAn efficient, nonrecursive algorithm is given for moving any LISP-type list.  In particular, the algorithm requires no storage other than the new nodes into which the list is to be moved, and no additional bits per node for marking; the algorithm runs in time proportional to the number of nodes in the list.  The original list structure is destroyed as it is moved.CACM May, 1973Reingold, E. M.list moving, list copying, list traversal, garbage collection LISP4.19 4.49CA730507 JB January 23, 1978  4:45 PM
