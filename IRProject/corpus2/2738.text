Use of the Concept of Transparency in the Design of Hierarchically Structured SystemsThis paper deals with the design of hierarchically structured programming systems.  It develops a method for evaluating the cost of requiring programmers to work with an abstraction of a real machine. A number of examples from hardware and software are given as illustrations of the method.CACM July, 1975Parnas, D. L. Siewiorek, D.
