Using Page Residency To Select the Working Set ParameterDenning's method for selecting the working set parameter, which uses interreference intervals, is examined.

Using this modified model, Dening's results on page residency are rederived and reconsidered for selecting the working set parameter.CACM October, 1973Prieve, B.
