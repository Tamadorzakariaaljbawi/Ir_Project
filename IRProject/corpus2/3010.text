Value Orientation of Computer Science StudentsTechnological and nontechnological value orientations are investigated with special attention to the complexity of value structures.  Computer science students, who are closely associated with technology, contrast with social science students, who are often technologically aloof.  This is confirmed by the value ratings of 313 students at the University of Minnesota in 1972.  Computer science majors were found to have a more complex value structure than social science majors.CACM March, 1978Anderson, R.E.values, attitudes, students, public, social effects2.11 2.12CA780303 JB March 28, 1978  1:21 PM
