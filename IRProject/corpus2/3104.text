Test Data as an Aid in Proving Program CorrectnessProofs of program correctness tend to be long and tedious, whereas testing, though useful in detecting errors, usually does not guarantee correctness. This paper introduces a techniques whereby test data can be used in proving program correctness. In addition to simplifying the process of proving correctness, this method simplifies the process of providing accurate specification for a program.  The applicability of this technique to procedures and recursive programs is demonstrated.CACM May, 1978Geller, M.Program verification, program testing, recursive programs4.22 4.6 5.24CA780503 DH February 26, 1979  2:10 PM
