VMIN-An Optimal Variable-Space Page Replacement AlgorithmA criterion for comparing variable space page replacement algorithms is presented.  An optimum page replacement algorithm, called VMIN, is described and shown to be optimum with respect to this criterion. The results of simulating VMIN, Denning's working set, and the page partitioning replacement algorithms on five virtual memory programs are presented to demonstrate the improvement possible over the known realizable variable space algorithms.CACM May, 1976Prieve, B.
