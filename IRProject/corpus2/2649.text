On the Distributions of Significant Digits and Roundoff ErrorsGeneralized logarithmic law is derived for the distribution of the first t significant digits of a random digital integer.  This result is then used to determine the distribution of the roundoff errors in floating-point operations, which is a mixture of uniform and reciprocal distributions.CACM May, 1974Tsao, N.significant digits, floating-point operations, roundoff errors, uniform distribution, reciprocal distribution, variance, mean valve5.10 5.11CA740504 JB January 17, 1978  4:12 PM
