Boolean matrix Methods for the Detection of Simple Precedence GrammarsA mechanical procedure is derived for determining whether a given context-free phrase structure grammar is a simple precedence grammar.  This procedure consists of elementary operations on suitably defined Boolean matrices.  Application of the procedure to operator grammars is also given.CACM October, 1968Martin, D.
