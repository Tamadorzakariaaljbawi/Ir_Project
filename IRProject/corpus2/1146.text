An Efficient Composite Formula for Multidimensional QuadratureA (2s+1)-point second-degree quadrature formula for integration over an s-dimensional hyper-rectangle is presented.  All but one of the points lie on the surface with weights of opposite sign attached to points on opposite faces.  When a large volume is subdivided into congruent rectangular subdivisions, only one point is required in each interior subdivision to achieve second-degree accuracy.CACM January, 1964Thacher Jr., H.
