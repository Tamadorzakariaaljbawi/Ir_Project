A Model for and DIscussion of Multi-Interpreter SystemsA multi-interpreter system is a system in which programs execute by virtue of being interpreted by other programs, which themselves may either be interpreted (i.e. nested interpreters) or run directly on the host machine.  The model reveals the anatomy of interpreters and how these differ from procedures, and exhibits links to protection domains and multiprocessor architectures.CACM May, 1979Manthey, M.J.Interpreters, transfer-of-control, hierarchies4.13 3.65CA790505 DH August 21, 19791:14 PM
