A Note on the Efficiency of a LISP Computation in a Paged MachineThe problem of the use of two levels of storage for programs is explored in the context of a LISP system which uses core memory as a buffer for a large virtual memory stored on a drum.  Details of timing are given for one particular problem.CACM August, 1968Borrow, D. G. Murphy, D.
