Complex Matrix Inversion Versus RealA comparison of complex matrix with real matrix inversion is made.  It is shown that the complex inversion can be up to twice as fast as the real inversion.  Further, the rounding error bound for complex inversion is about one-eighth that of real, for Gaussian elimination.  Using extended inner product accumulation the bound is half of the real system.CACM September, 1970Ehrlich, L.
