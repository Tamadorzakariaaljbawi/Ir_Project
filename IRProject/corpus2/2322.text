A View of computer ArchitectureAn attempt is made to predict the developments of the next 25 years in the field of computer architecture.  Standardized, inexpensive microcomputers on a single chip are predicted.  These will be used extensively to provide logical functions for noncomputational devices and incidentally for the design of superscale computers.CACM July, 1972Foster, C.
