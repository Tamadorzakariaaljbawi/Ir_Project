Mathematical Experimentation in Time-Lag ModulationEquations of the form du/dt = g(u(t),u(h(t))) arise in a number of scientific contexts.  The authors point out some interesting properties of the solution u'(t) = -u(t-1-k*sin(wt))+sin(at).  These properties were obtained by means of numerical solution.CACM October, 1966Bellman, R.
