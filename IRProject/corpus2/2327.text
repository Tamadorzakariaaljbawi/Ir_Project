Toward an Automata Theory of BrainsA source of ideas for automata theory-the study of the brain-has been pushed aside in mathematical development of the theory.  This paper suggests the ways in which automata theory might evolve over the next 25 years if it is to contribute to an understanding of how the brain processes information.CACM July, 1972Arbib, M.
