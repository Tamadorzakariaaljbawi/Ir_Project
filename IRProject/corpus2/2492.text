The Development of Decision Tables via Parsing of Complex Decision SituationsA new parsing technique is proposed which allows parsing based only on syntactical characteristics of the decision problem.  It requires a description of the problem in decision grid chart format and allows the development of decision tables within defined limits by avoiding, or at least minimizing, repetition of conditions and actions in the resulting tables.CACM June, 1973Strunz, H.decision tables, parsing, decision grid chart,problem analysis4.0 4.1 4.2CA730608 JB January 23, 1978  2:10 PM
