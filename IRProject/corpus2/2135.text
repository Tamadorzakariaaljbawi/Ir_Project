Rapid Computation of General Interpolation Formulas and Mechanical Quadrature RulesLet f have n continuous on a closed interval [a,b] and let L be a linear functional.  The attempt is made to approximate L (f) with L (Q) where Q is a polynomial, approximating f.  Algorithms are developed for rapid computation of L (Q) for a wide class of selections of Q which includes the Lagrangian and Hermitian rules as special cases.CACM December, 1971Gustafson, S.linear functionals, divided differences, Newton's interpolation formula5.13 5.16CA711208 JB February 2, 1978  9:49 AM
