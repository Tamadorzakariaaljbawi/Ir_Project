Monitors: An Operating System Structuring ConceptThis paper develops Brinch-Hansen's concept of a monitor as a method of structuring an operating system.  It introduces a form of synchronization, describes a possible method of implementation in terms of semaphores and gives a suitable proof rule.  Illustrative examples include a single resource scheduler, a bounded buffer, an alarm clock, a buffer pool, a disk head optimizer, and a version of the problem of readers and writers.CACM October, 1974Hoare, C.
