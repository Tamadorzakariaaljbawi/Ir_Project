Algorithms To Reveal Properties of Floating-Point ArithmeticTwo algorithms are presented in the form of Fortran subroutines.  Each subroutine computes the radix and number of digits of the floating-point numbers and whether rounding or chopping is done by the machine on which it is run.  The methods are shown to work on any "reasonable" floating-point computer.CACM November, 1972Malcolm, M.
