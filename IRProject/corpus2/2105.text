An Interactive Computer System Using Graphical Flowchart InputAn interactive computer system operational on a graphical computer terminal is described.  This system was designed to demonstrate a method of programming by computer interpretation of a flowchart.  The user draws a description of a sampled-data system and specifies description is transmitted to a large scale computer.  The design is simulated, and a graphic representation of the processed signal is returned to the scope.  A successful design may require numerous modifications of the original design.  A graphical interactive system provides an environment to perform this iterative process efficiently and effectively.CACM February, 1970Robins, M. F. Beyer, J.
