A Variation of the Goodman-Lance Method for the Solution of Two-Point Boundary Value ProblemsA recently published method for the interpolative solution of nonlinear equations is improved, and applied to give a significant variation of the Goodman-Lance method for the solution of two-point boundary value problems. The resulting method applies in particular to the numerical solution of optimal control problems in the Euler-Lagrange formulation. Quantitative estimates are presented which indicate that the variation is nearly twice as fast on some problems in the latter context.CACM September, 1970Kimble, G.
