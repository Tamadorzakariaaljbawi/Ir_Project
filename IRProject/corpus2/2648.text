A Design for a Number Theory Package with an Optimized Trial Division routineA number theory package is described which uses doubly linked list structures for storing multiprecise integers.  The package has been coded in IBM's Basic Assembly Language and makes heavy use of the macro language and conditional assembly.  An optimally coded trial division routine is also described which can be used to determine the unique factorization of large integers.CACM May, 1974Wunderlich, M. C. Selfridge, J.
