Complexity of ComputationsThe framework for research in the theory of complexity of computations is described, emphasizing the in terrelation between seemingly diverse problems and methods.  Illustrative examples of practical and theoretical significance are given.  Directions for new research are discussed.CACM September, 1977Rabin, M.
