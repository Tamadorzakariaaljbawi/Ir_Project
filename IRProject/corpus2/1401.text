Quasilinearization and the Calculation of EigenvaluesSeveral eigenvalue problems for systems of ordinary differential equations are considered. They are resolved computationally using the quasilinerization technique, a quadratically convergent successive approximation scheme related to the Newton-Raphson-Kantorovich method.CACM July, 1966Bellman, R., Kagiwada, H.
