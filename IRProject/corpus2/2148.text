The Composition of Semantics in Algol 68The main features of Algol 68 are explained from a semantic point of view.  It is shown how the language permits the composition of values and actions, i.e. ultimately programs, from a minimum set of primitives with a few fundamental recursive rules of composition.  The associated syntax is briefly reviewed.  An attempt has been made to obtain a structured and simple introduction to both Algol 68 and its orthogonal design.CACM November, 1971Branquart, P.
