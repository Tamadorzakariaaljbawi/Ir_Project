A Numerical Integration Formula Useful in Fourier AnalysisA numerical integration formula is presented which uses unequal sampling intervals.  The intervals are equally spaced on a log scale.  Such a formulation is useful in Fourier analysis to improve accuracy and ease of usage.  A complete set of formulas for numerical Fourier analysis is given.CACM January, 1968Meisel, W.
