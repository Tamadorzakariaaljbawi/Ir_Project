Full Table Quadratic Searching for Scatter StorageThe quadratic residue search method for hash tables avoids much of the clustering experienced with a linear search method.  The simple quadratic search only accesses half the table.  It has been shown that when the length of the table is a prime of the form 4n+3, where n is an integer, the whole table may be accessed by two quadratic searches plus a separate access for the original entry point. A search method is presented which is computationally simple, has all the advantages of the quadratic search, and yet accesses all the table in one sweep.CACM August, 1970Day, A.
