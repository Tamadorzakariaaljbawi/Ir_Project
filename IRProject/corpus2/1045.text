Programming Analysis of Variance by Sequences of Operators and Isomorphic MappingsA special operator calculus developed by Hartley in 1956 together with a new mapping scheme has been found to be efficient in programming analysis of variance for multifactor experiments. The operator calculus and the mapping scheme are described in detail.CACM July, 1964Peng, K. C.CA640702 JB March 9, 1978  8:30 PM
