A Linear Algorithm for Incremental Digital Display of Circular ArcsCircular arcs can be drawn on an incremental display device such as a cathode ray tube, digital plotter, or matrix prin ter using only sign testing and elementary addition and subtraction.  This paper describes methodology for producing dot or step patterns closet to the true circle.CACM February, 1977Bresenham, J.graphics, circle drawing, step generation, dot generation, incremental digital plotting, raster display, integer arithmetic, circle algorithm4.41 8.2CA770207 JB December 30, 1977  2:16 AM
