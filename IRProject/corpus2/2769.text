A Modification of Warshall's Algorithm for the Transitive Closure of Binary RelationsAn algorithm is given for computing the transitive closure of a binary relation that is represented by a Boolean matrix. The algorithm is similar to Warshall's although it executes faster for sparse matrices on most computers, particularly in a paging environment.CACM April, 1975Warren, H. S.
