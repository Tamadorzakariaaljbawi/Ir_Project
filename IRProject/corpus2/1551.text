On Compiling Algorithms for Arithmetic ExpressionsThis paper deals with algorithms concerning arithmetic expressions used in a FORTRAN IV compiler for a HITAC-5020 computer having n accumulators.  The algorithms generate an object code which minimizes the frequency of storing and recovering the partial results of the arithmetic expressions in cases where there are several accumulators.CACM August, 1967Nakata, I.CA670804 JB February 27, 1978  4:35 PM
