A Note on Compiling Fixed Point Binary MultiplicationsAn algorithm is developed for compiling, as a sequence of shifts, additions,and subtractions, many fixed point binary multiplications involving a constant.  The most significant characteristics of the algorithm are the simplicity of the test which determines if the algorithm should be applied and the degree to which it "suggests" efficient object code.CACM June, 1971Glaswin, H.
