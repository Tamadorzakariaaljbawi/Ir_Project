An Improved Hash Code for Scatter StorageIntroduced is a hash coding method based on fixed-point division rather than multiplication or logical operations.  This new method allows the hash table to have almost any length.  Also a new method of handling collisions is discussed.  Known as quadratic search, this method is faster than random search and free from the "clusters" that build up with a linear search.CACM January, 1968Maurer, W.
