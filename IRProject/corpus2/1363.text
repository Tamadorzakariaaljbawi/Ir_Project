A General Method of Systematic Interval Computation for Numerical Integration of Initial Value ProblemsA procedure is given for continuously computing and monitoring the step size to be used by a self-starting, p-th order numerical integration method to solve an initial value problem.  The procedure uses an estimate of the truncation error to calculate the step size.CACM October, 1966Martin, W. C. Paulson, K. C. Sashkin, L.CA661004 JB March 2, 1978  4:05 PM
