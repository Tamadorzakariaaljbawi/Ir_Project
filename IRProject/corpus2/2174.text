The Stable Marriage ProblemThe original work of Gale and Shapley on an assignment method using the stable marriage criterion has been extended to find all the stable marriage assignments. The algorithm derived for finding all the stable marriage assignments is proved to satisfy all the conditions of the problem.  Algorithm 411 applies to this paper.CACM July, 1971McVitie, D. G.
