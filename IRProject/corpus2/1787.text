Use of Transition Matrices in CompilingAn algorithms is described which constructs from a suitable BNF grammar an efficient left-right recognizer for sentences of the corresponding language. The type of recognizer, used in a number of compilers, operates with a pushdown stack and with a transition matrix.  Two examples illustrate how such recognizers may be used effectively for other purposes besides the usual syntax checking.CACM January, 1968Gries, D.transition matrices, compilation, translation, grammar, context-free language, formal language, parsing4.12 5.23CA680107 JB February 23, 1978  2:35 PM
