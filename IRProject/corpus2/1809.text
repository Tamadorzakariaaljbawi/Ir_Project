Numerical Analysis in a Ph.D. Computer Science ProgramNumerical Analysis is the study of methods and procedures used to obtain "approximate solutions" to mathematical problems.  Much of the emphasis is on scientific calculation.  The difficulties of education in such a broad area center around the question of background and emphasis.  The Numerical Analysis program in the Computer Science Department should emphasize an awareness of the problems of computer implementation and experimental procedures.  Nevertheless, there is a need for a solid background in applied mathematics.CACM December, 1969Parter, S.
