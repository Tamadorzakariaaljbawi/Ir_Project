Numerical Mathematics and Computer ScienceNumerical mathematics is viewed as the analysis of continuous algorithms.  Four of the components of numerical mathematics are discussed.  These are: foundations (finite precision number systems, computational complexity), synthesis and analysis of algorithms, analysis of error, programs and program libraries.CACM July, 1972Traub, J.
